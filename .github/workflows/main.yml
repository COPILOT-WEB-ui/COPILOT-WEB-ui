Navigate to your repository.
Go to .github/workflows/ and create a new file, e.g., main.yml.
Define Your Workflow:
Use the following template to set up a basic CI/CD pipeline:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Deploy
      run: npm run deploy

Customize as Needed:
Modify the node-version, install, test, and deploy commands to fit your projectâ€™s requirements.
Commit and Push:
Commit your changes and push them to the main branch.
This setup will automatically run your defined actions whenever code is pushed to the main branch or a pull request is made. Feel free to expand and customize the workflow to suit your specific needs! If you need more detailed steps or have specific requirements, let me know!
